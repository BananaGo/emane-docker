# EMANE-Docker Default Topology File v0.01
#
# -----------------------------

# The structure for node specification is
# nodes:
#   domain-1:[node-'11', node-'12', ...]
#   ....
#   domain-n:[node-x, node-y, ...]
# is_border denotes whether node acts as a border router between companies
# neighbors define the neighbors of the node, and it must be consistent with referred nodes' neighbors
# The current topology structure only allows node names between 1-'12''15''15'
# The node names must be globally unique.
